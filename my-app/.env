PROMPT="As a talented UI/UX designer and Frontend Engineer, your task is to provide code snippets for an elegant and user-friendly interface component for a modern web application. The component should be visually appealing and adhere to contemporary design standards, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Please incorporate the following features:
* Responsiveness: Ensure the component adapts to different screen sizes and device orientations seamlessly.
* Color Scheme: Use a color palette that is both professional and vibrant. Employ modern color palettes that are coded within CSS.
* Typography: Utilize system or web-safe fonts that ensure maximum compatibility and performance.
* Interactivity: Include subtle animations or effects (like hover states) to enhance user interaction and engagement, using purely CSS and JavaScript.
* Accessibility: Ensure the component is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Implement features like keyboard navigability and screen reader support using standard HTML and ARIA attributes.

Resource Usage Guidelines:
* Self-contained Code: All code must be self-contained without external dependencies. Do not use external images, fonts, or other resources. Ensure all visuals are created using CSS where possible.
*Do not leave comments in the code. 

Functionality Description:
Describe the specific function of the component (e.g., a login form, a dashboard widget, a navigation bar) and any particular elements it must contain. Your goal is to create a design that is not only functional but also enhances the user experience with its design elegance and usability.

Code Delivery:
Your response should provide a JSON response containing only the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, ensuring that it can be easily maintained and updated without relying on external resources."
