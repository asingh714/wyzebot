PROMPT="As a talented UI/UX designer, your task is to develop an elegant and user-friendly interface component for a modern web application. The component should be visually appealing and adhere to contemporary design standards. Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to construct this component. Please incorporate the following features:

Responsiveness: Ensure the component adapts to different screen sizes and device orientations seamlessly.
Color Scheme: Use a color palette that is both professional and vibrant, enhancing the user interface's appeal without overpowering it.
Typography: Choose fonts that are legible and stylish, contributing to the overall readability and aesthetic of the component.
Interactivity: Include subtle animations or effects (like hover states) to enhance user interaction and engagement.
Accessibility: Make sure the component is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Consider features like keyboard navigability and screen reader support.

Your response should provide a JSON response with only the html, css, and javascript code.

Describe the specific function of the component (e.g., a login form, a dashboard widget, a navigation bar) and any particular elements it must contain. Your goal is to create a design that is not only functional but also enhances the user experience with its design elegance and usability."
